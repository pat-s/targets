#' @family targets
#' @description A target is a single step of computation in a pipeline.
#'   It runs an R command and returns a value.
#'   This value gets treated as an R object that can be used
#'   by the commands of targets downstream. Targets that
#'   are already up to date are skipped. See the user manual
#'   for more details.
#' @section Target objects:
#'   Functions like `tar_target()` produce target objects,
#'   special objects with specialized sets of S3 classes.
#'   Target objects represent skippable steps of the analysis pipeline
#'   as described at <https://books.ropensci.org/targets/>.
#'   Please read the walkthrough at
#'   <https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html>
#'   to understand the role of target objects in analysis pipelines.
#'
#'   For developers,
#'   <https://wlandau.github.io/targetopia/contributing.html#target-factories>
#'   explains target factories (functions like this one which generate targets)
#'   and the design specification at
#'   <https://books.ropensci.org/targets-design/>
#'   details the structure and composition of target objects.
#' @section Storage formats:
#'   * `"rds"`: Default, uses `saveRDS()` and `readRDS()`. Should work for
#'     most objects, but slow.
#'   * `"qs"`: Uses `qs::qsave()` and `qs::qread()`. Should work for
#'     most objects, much faster than `"rds"`. Optionally set the
#'     preset for `qsave()` through `tar_resources()` and `tar_resources_qs()`.
#'   * `"feather"`: Uses `arrow::write_feather()` and
#'     `arrow::read_feather()` (version 2.0). Much faster than `"rds"`,
#'     but the value must be a data frame. Optionally set
#'     `compression` and `compression_level` in `arrow::write_feather()`
#'     through `tar_resources()` and `tar_resources_feather()`.
#'     Requires the `arrow` package (not installed by default).
#'   * `"parquet"`: Uses `arrow::write_parquet()` and
#'     `arrow::read_parquet()` (version 2.0). Much faster than `"rds"`,
#'     but the value must be a data frame. Optionally set
#'     `compression` and `compression_level` in `arrow::write_parquet()`
#'     through `tar_resources()` and `tar_resources_parquet()`.
#'     Requires the `arrow` package (not installed by default).
#'   * `"fst"`: Uses `fst::write_fst()` and `fst::read_fst()`.
#'     Much faster than `"rds"`, but the value must be
#'     a data frame. Optionally set the compression level for
#'     `fst::write_fst()` through `tar_resources()` and `tar_resources_fst()`.
#'     Requires the `fst` package (not installed by default).
#'   * `"fst_dt"`: Same as `"fst"`, but the value is a `data.table`.
#'     Optionally set the compression level the same way as for `"fst"`.
#'   * `"fst_tbl"`: Same as `"fst"`, but the value is a `tibble`.
#'     Optionally set the compression level the same way as for `"fst"`.
#'   * `"keras"`: Uses `keras::save_model_hdf5()` and
#'     `keras::load_model_hdf5()`. The value must be a Keras model.
#'     Requires the `keras` package (not installed by default).
#'   * `"torch"`: Uses `torch::torch_save()` and `torch::torch_load()`.
#'     The value must be an object from the `torch` package
#'     such as a tensor or neural network module.
#'     Requires the `torch` package (not installed by default).
#'   * `"file"`: A dynamic file. To use this format,
#'     the target needs to manually identify or save some data
#'     and return a character vector of paths
#'     to the data. (These paths must be existing files
#'     and nonempty directories.)
#'     Then, `targets` automatically checks those files and cues
#'     the appropriate build decisions if those files are out of date.
#'     Those paths must point to files or directories,
#'     and they must not contain characters `|` or `*`.
#'     All the files and directories you return must actually exist,
#'     or else `targets` will throw an error. (And if `storage` is `"worker"`,
#'     `targets` will first stall out trying to wait for the file
#'     to arrive over a network file system.)
#'     If the target does not create any files, the return value should be
#'     `character(0)`.
#'   * `"url"`: A dynamic input URL. For this storage format,
#'     `repository` is implicitly `"local"`,
#'     URL format is like `format = "file"`
#'     except the return value of the target is a URL that already exists
#'     and serves as input data for downstream targets. Optionally
#'     supply a custom `curl` handle through
#'     `tar_resources()` and `tar_resources_url()`.
#'     in `new_handle()`, `nobody = TRUE` is important because it
#'     ensures `targets` just downloads the metadata instead of
#'     the entire data file when it checks time stamps and hashes.
#'     The data file at the URL needs to have an ETag or a Last-Modified
#'     time stamp, or else the target will throw an error because
#'     it cannot track the data. Also, use extreme caution when
#'     trying to use `format = "url"` to track uploads. You must be absolutely
#'     certain the ETag and Last-Modified time stamp are fully updated
#'     and available by the time the target's command finishes running.
#'     `targets` makes no attempt to wait for the web server.
#'   * A custom format can be supplied with `tar_format()`. For this choice,
#'     it is the user's responsibility to provide methods for (un)serialization
#'     and (un)marshaling the return value of the target.
#'   * The formats starting with `"aws_"` are deprecated as of 2022-03-13
#'     (`targets version > 0.10.0). For cloud storage integration, use the
#'     `repository` argument instead.
#' @param repository Character of length 1, remote repository for target
#'   storage. Choices:
#'   * `"local"`: file system of the local machine.
#'   * `"aws"`: Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket. Can be configured
#'     with a non-AWS S3 bucket using the `endpoint` argument of
#'     [tar_resources_aws()], but versioning capabilities may be lost
#'     in doing so.
#'     See the cloud storage section of
#'     <https://books.ropensci.org/targets/data.html>
#'     for details for instructions.
#'   * `"gcp"`: Google Cloud Platform storage bucket.
#'     See the cloud storage section of
#'     <https://books.ropensci.org/targets/data.html>
#'     for details for instructions.
#' @param iteration Character of length 1, name of the iteration mode
#'   of the target. Choices:
#'   * `"vector"`: branching happens with `vctrs::vec_slice()` and
#'     aggregation happens with `vctrs::vec_c()`.
#'   * `"list"`, branching happens with `[[]]` and aggregation happens with
#'     `list()`.
#'   * `"group"`: `dplyr::group_by()`-like functionality to branch over
#'     subsets of a data frame. The target's return value must be a data
#'     frame with a special `tar_group` column of consecutive integers
#'     from 1 through the number of groups. Each integer designates a group,
#'     and a branch is created for each collection of rows in a group.
#'     See the [tar_group()] function to see how you can
#'     create the special `tar_group` column with `dplyr::group_by()`.
#' @return A target object. Users should not modify these directly,
#'   just feed them to [list()] in your target script file
#'   (default: `_targets.R`).
#' @param name Symbol, name of the target. A target
#'   name must be a valid name for a symbol in R, and it
#'   must not start with a dot. Subsequent targets
#'   can refer to this name symbolically to induce a dependency relationship:
#'   e.g. `tar_target(downstream_target, f(upstream_target))` is a
#'   target named `downstream_target` which depends on a target
#'   `upstream_target` and a function `f()`. In addition, a target's
#'   name determines its random number generator seed. In this way,
#'   each target runs with a reproducible seed so someone else
#'   running the same pipeline should get the same results,
#'   and no two targets in the same pipeline share the same seed.
#'   (Even dynamic branches have different names and thus different seeds.)
#'   You can recover the seed of a completed target
#'   with `tar_meta(your_target, seed)` and run `set.seed()` on the result
#'   to locally recreate the target's initial RNG state.
#' @param command R code to run the target.
#' @param pattern Language to define branching for a target.
#'   For example, in a pipeline with numeric vector targets `x` and `y`,
#'   `tar_target(z, x + y, pattern = map(x, y))` implicitly defines
#'   branches of `z` that each compute `x[1] + y[1]`, `x[2] + y[2]`,
#'   and so on. See the user manual for details.
#' @param tidy_eval Logical, whether to enable tidy evaluation
#'   when interpreting `command` and `pattern`. If `TRUE`, you can use the
#'   "bang-bang" operator `!!` to programmatically insert
#'   the values of global objects.
#' @param packages Character vector of packages to load right before
#'   the target builds or the output data is reloaded for
#'   downstream targets. Use `tar_option_set()` to set packages
#'   globally for all subsequent targets you define.
#' @param library Character vector of library paths to try
#'   when loading `packages`.
#' @param format Optional storage format for the target's return value.
#'   With the exception of `format = "file"`, each target
#'   gets a file in `_targets/objects`, and each format is a different
#'   way to save and load this file. See the "Storage formats" section
#'   in [tar_target()] for a detailed list of possible data storage formats.
#' @param error Character of length 1, what to do if the target
#'   stops and throws an error. Options:
#'   * `"stop"`: the whole pipeline stops and throws an error.
#'   * `"continue"`: the whole pipeline keeps going.
#'   * `"abridge"`: any currently running targets keep running,
#'     but no new targets launch after that.
#'   (Visit <https://books.ropensci.org/targets/debugging.html>
#'   to learn how to debug targets using saved workspaces.)
#'   * `"null"`: The errored target continues and returns `NULL`.
#'     The data hash is deliberately wrong so the target is not
#'     up to date for the next run of the pipeline.
#' @param memory Character of length 1, memory strategy.
#'   If `"persistent"`, the target stays in memory
#'   until the end of the pipeline (unless `storage` is `"worker"`,
#'   in which case `targets` unloads the value from memory
#'   right after storing it in order to avoid sending
#'   copious data over a network).
#'   If `"transient"`, the target gets unloaded
#'   after every new target completes.
#'   Either way, the target gets automatically loaded into memory
#'   whenever another target needs the value.
#'   For cloud-based dynamic files such as `format = "aws_file"`,
#'   this memory strategy applies to
#'   temporary local copies of the file in `_targets/scratch/"`:
#'   `"persistent"` means they remain until the end of the pipeline,
#'   and `"transient"` means they get deleted from the file system
#'   as soon as possible. The former conserves bandwidth,
#'   and the latter conserves local storage.
#' @param garbage_collection Logical, whether to run `base::gc()`
#'   just before the target runs.
#' @param deployment Character of length 1, only relevant to
#'   [tar_make_clustermq()] and [tar_make_future()]. If `"worker"`,
#'   the target builds on a parallel worker. If `"main"`,
#'   the target builds on the host machine / process managing the pipeline.
#' @param priority Numeric of length 1 between 0 and 1. Controls which
#'   targets get deployed first when multiple competing targets are ready
#'   simultaneously. Targets with priorities closer to 1 get built earlier
#'   (and polled earlier in [tar_make_future()]).
#' @param resources Object returned by `tar_resources()`
#'   with optional settings for high-performance computing
#'   functionality, alternative data storage formats,
#'   and other optional capabilities of `targets`.
#'   See `tar_resources()` for details.
#' @param storage Character of length 1, only relevant to
#'   [tar_make_clustermq()] and [tar_make_future()].
#'   Must be one of the following values:
#'   * `"main"`: the target's return value is sent back to the
#'   host machine and saved/uploaded locally.
#'   * `"worker"`: the worker saves/uploads the value.
#'   * `"none"`: almost never recommended. It is only for
#'     niche situations, e.g. the data needs to be loaded
#'     explicitly from another language. If you do use it,
#'     then the return value of the target is totally ignored
#'     when the target ends, but
#'     each downstream target still attempts to load the data file
#'     (except when `retrieval = "none"`).
#'
#'     If you select `storage = "none"`, then
#'     the return value of the target's command is ignored,
#'     and the data is not saved automatically.
#'     As with dynamic files (`format = "file"` or `"aws_file"`) it is the
#'     responsibility of the user to write to
#'     [tar_path()] from inside the target.
#'     An example target
#'     could look something like
#'     tar_target(x,
#'     {saveRDS("value", tar_path(create_dir = TRUE)); "ignored"},
#'     storage = "none")`.
#'
#'     The distinguishing feature of `storage = "none"`
#'     (as opposed to `format = "file"` or `"aws_file"`)
#'     is that in the general case,
#'     downstream targets will automatically try to load the data
#'     from the data store as a dependency. As a corollary, `storage = "none"`
#'     is completely unnecessary if `format` is `"file"` or `"aws_file"`.
#' @param retrieval Character of length 1, only relevant to
#'   [tar_make_clustermq()] and [tar_make_future()].
#'   Must be one of the following values:
#'   * `"main"`: the target's dependencies are loaded on the host machine
#'     and sent to the worker before the target builds.
#'   * `"worker"`: the worker loads the targets dependencies.
#'   * `"none"`: the dependencies are not loaded at all.
#'     This choice is almost never recommended. It is only for
#'     niche situations, e.g. the data needs to be loaded
#'     explicitly from another language.
#' @param cue An optional object from `tar_cue()` to customize the
#'   rules that decide whether the target is up to date.
